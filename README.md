# Personalised-Quantization
The user enters the quantization step Q, the number of intervals on the abscissa axis and their value to obtain a generic piecewise linear g (x) function and its corresponding quantization. If a value equal to that of the quantization step Q is given to all the intervals, a linear quantization will be obtained; on the other hand, if even a single interval should have any value other than that of the quantization step Q, a non-linear quantization will be obtained. Furthermore, the horizontal steps represent the approximate values (through quantization in fact) of the different segments that make up the piecewise linear function.
